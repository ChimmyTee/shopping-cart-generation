# shopping-cart-generation

This is a shopping cart app for a hard coded array of objects as products.

This app will be using mostly HTML, CSS and Javascript.
The app will be supported by Bootstrap 5 grids and it's two component "card" and "off-canvas". 

Here are the requirements of the app:
1. Pre-populate (hard code) an array of objects as products.
2. Product display should have (not limited to) product image, product name, product price.
3. All products should be displayed when the page loads.
4. "Add to Cart" button will be required to add the products to a shopping cart list.
5. The shopping cart lists all products and displays the total price.
6. The user can delete products from the cart, thus update the total price of the cart.
7. The user should be able to enter a quantity for each product.

The app utlitises a system of keeping the 'delete button' and 'add to cart button' consistent and attached an ID to the button.
This allows us to easily target product throughout the application.
